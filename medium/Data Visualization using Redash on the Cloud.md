Data visualization is a very important step to better understand the data and monitor a company‚Äôs activity.

> **Redash**  is a very powerful Data Viz tool to  **connect**  to any data source (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redshift, BigQuery, MongoDB, Databricks, and many others),  **query**,  **visualize**  and  **share**  your data to make your company data-driven ‚Äî  [Redash](https://redash.io/).

It is the official DataViz tool integrated inside  [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2020/06/24/welcoming-redash-to-databricks.html), the unified platform for data science, data engineering, data analyst, ML engineer

Running Redash for the first time may require some experience, depending on where you would like to deploy it.

In this beginner-friendly article, I will cover step-by-step how two deploy it on AWS Cloud.

# Supported Data Source:

-   Amazon Athena,
-   Amazon CloudWatch
-   Amazon Redshift
-   Axibase Time Series Database
-   BigQuery
-   CSV Files
-   CSV Files (Deprecated)
-   Databricks
-   DynamoDB
-   Elasticsearch
-   Google Analytics
-   Google Sheets
-   JIRA
-   JSON API‚Äôs
-   Microsoft Azure SQL Database & Synapse
-   MongoDB
-   Python

# 5 Simple Steps

Using Redash is very simple, here are the 5 steps in order to achieve a stunning result for DataViz

-   Add a data source
-   Write a query
-   Add a visualization
-   Create a Dashboard
-   Invite colleagues

More details can be found  [here](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/getting-started#5-Invite-Colleagues).

Redash uses technologies such as  `postgres`  ,  `Redis`  and  `NGIX`.

# Setup Redash on the AWS Cloud

# Create an EC2 instance

Head to the  [setup page](https://redash.io/help/open-source/setup#-AWS)  and click on one AMI link on the left column of the table as shown in the image below

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*0jVCuSjev5q1MffYw9o_2A.png)

-   In my case, I chose the one inside the purple rectangle ([AWS EC2 EU-West-3](https://eu-west-3.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=eu-west-3#LaunchInstances:ami=ami-041bf9180061ce7ea))

Once on the AWS EC2 webpage, you must sign in, then, you will be walked through different configurations to set up the instance.

-   An ubuntu image with Redash installed is preselected from the catalog

-   For the  **instance type**, make sure you select at least  `t2.small`  as shown in the image below

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*PxzuCqdsr-EUBYYLvBleKg.png)

-   For the  **Network setting**, here is my configuration, of course, you can create a new VPC and Security Group or just reuse existing ones.

_Note_: Make sure  `Auto-assign public IP`  is enabled

-   The rest of the steps are pretty straightforward, so you should be able to follow along
-   In the end, you should validate the instance summary and proceed to the creation of the instance

_Note_: Do not forget to keep the key pair file you created to connect later to the instance locally from an SSH client

# Connect to AWS EC2 instance

After the creation of the instance, comes the time to connect to it in order to interact with the machine and launch the Redash dashboard. I chose to connect via SSH client (e.g. OpenSSH in my Ubuntu). Head over to the  `connect to instance`  then  `SSH client`  to see the steps to follow to establish a connection

-   The details from the screenshot above are straightforward. From the terminal (Ubuntu in my case), run the following commands, and make sure the user name is  `ubuntu`  (and not  `root`)

chmod 400 Redash_key_pair.pem     
ssh -v -i "Redash_key_pair.pem" [ubuntu@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com](mailto:ubuntu@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-xxx.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com)

-   After login, you should get a similar log

# Access Redash UI

-   First, note the Public IP address as shown in the image below

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/608/1*Y9TfeS9g8qJdWeqE08lDmg.png)

-   From here, you just have to open a browser on your local machine and insert the public IP address (`Xx.xx.xxx.xxx`) of the AWS EC2 instance followed by port 5000 (i.e,  `http://Xx.xx.xxx.xxx:5000/`). If everything is correct, you should get a similar result

-   After filling out the form and clicking on  `Setup`  you should land on the home page üöÄüöÄüöÄ

ü•≥Ô∏è  **Congratulations**  if you made it this far ü•≥Ô∏è

-   Now that Redash is up and running, you just need to follow the steps highlighted by the purple rectangle in the previous image, connect a data source, create a query, create a dashboard, and Voila!

# Dashboard Example

Now it is time to  [get creative](https://redash.io/help/user-guide/visualizations/visualizations-how-to), here is an example I made using structured numerical data

# Conclusion

Data visualization is a very important step to better understand the data and monitor a company‚Äôs activity. Every organization operating in the data space should have one.

Rethdash is a very interesting solution that allows the user to connect to the data using different connectors, create interactive visualizations, and set up alerts, all that for FREE ü§Øü§Øü§Ø

When you think about it, you realized that you do not necessarily have to pay for a Microsoft Power BI license to achieve a similar result, I have used both of them.

If you are interested in contributing to Redash, find the project on Github:  [https://github.com/getredash](https://github.com/getredash)

Hopefully this was helpful.

Peace‚úåÔ∏è
