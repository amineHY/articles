A brief article and comment about  [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAqBL5gBXJ8MGhQh-qHYyxAOW-DYlHM3VLg)  talk and view on MLOps

I totally agree with  [Andrew Ng](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/?trk=homepage-basic_google-one-tap-submit#)  view about machine learning and MLops. People in data science are on the point of becoming magicians by focusing on a model-centric view! They focus mostly on training the latest sophisticated /complex models.

I want to think of it as if they want more and better lemon juice by focusing on building a sophisticated juicer! Probably the solution comes from having a better quality, juicy lemons, and a state-of-the-art juicer, hence, a  data-centric view is key.

In fact, the word “data” can sometimes be is misleading, e.g. what’s the point of having a BIG database that contains few/inconsistent/redundant/noisy information! useless. It takes more space to store, consume more computation (i.e. electric) power, difficult to handle and transfer…

Instead,  it is key to have clean, free from noise, relevant, non-redundant **Information** in the dataset, aka, data exploration and engineering

The AI community, the researcher included, get it wrong with ~99% papers on arXiv focus on the model-centric view and only ~1% focus on a data-centric view

# Experiment 1

@Andrew NG and his team from @deeplearning.ai conducted an experiment to highlight the difference between model-centric VS data-centric views on different ML projects (computer vision)

From this experiment, we can observe that a model-centric is limited and can not improve metrics that much compared to the baseline model, like the juicer that exploits the totality of the juice and can’t produce more juice. The data-centric approach was helpful to achieve better performance than the model-centric approach

# Experiment 2

Another experiment highlights the difference between using clean data vs noisy data. The results are spectacular, we observe that we need few clean data (e.g. 500 examples) instead of a lot of noisy data (1500 examples) to achieve the same performance, that a ratio of 3!

# Conclusion

I believe there is a lot of optimization to be done in the field of AI and that will be the focus in the next decade. Efficient and frugal AI.
