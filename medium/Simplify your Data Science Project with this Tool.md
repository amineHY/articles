# Description

This project is for creating a development environment for data scientists. It helps the users developing machine learning models in a simple way,

-   Focus on code, not on the tool.
-   Saving time that could be wasted during installing.
-   Prevent broking the OS by installing incompatible packages.

I hand-crafted  `AI-lab`  (on top of  [NVIDIA Container](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:tensorrt)) and took advantage of  [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)  capabilities to have a reproducible and portable development environment.

`AI-lab`  allows developing artificial intelligence (AI) based applications in Python using the most common artificial intelligence frameworks.  `AI-lab`  is meant to be used to building, training, validating, testing your deep learning tagheuer

models, for instance, is a good tool to do transfer learning.

It includes:

-   Ubuntu 18.04
-   NVIDIA CUDA 10.1
-   NVIDIA cuDNN 7.6.0
-   OpenCV 4.1.0
-   Python 3.6
-   Most common AI framework: TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, Keras, ONNX-TensorRT, Jupyter-lab, VS Code integration with remote development, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Pandas, TensorRT, and more.

# Install AI-lab

Some prerequisites need to be installed on the OS before using  `AI-lab`

-   You must have an operating system with AMD64 architecture. Check that in the terminal

dpkg --print-architecture

For example, I use Ubuntu 18.04.3 LST. You can check your system with this command

lsb_release -a

-   [NVIDIA drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)  and  [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

nvidia-smi

On my laptop machine, I have NVIDIA Driver version 430.50 and CUDA version 10.01.

-   Docker-ce must be installed on your OS. To install or reinstall docker-ce, please follow the original Docker-ce  [installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/), including the  [post-installation](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/)  steps for Linux.

docker

# Usage

## **First pull AI-lab from Docker Hub registry**:  [AI-lab](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/aminehy/ai-lab)

docker pull aminehy/ai-lab

The latest image has around 9.97GB, so make sure you have enough space (and high-speed internet).

## **Then run AI-lab and start your development**

xhost 

then

docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --runtime=nvidia -p 8888:8888 -p 6006:6006 aminehy/ai-lab

Done!

## **Install UFF converter** `**convert-to-uff**` **(if you need it)**

Once you run AI-lab, move to  `/opt/tensorrt/python`  folder and install  `convert-to-uff`  using the following commands:

cd /opt/tensorrt/python dpkg -i *-tf_*.deb UFF_PATH="$(python -c 'import uff; print(uff.__path__[0])')" chmod +x ${UFF_PATH}/bin/convert_to_uff.py ln -sf ${UFF_PATH}/bin/convert_to_uff.py /usr/local/bin/convert-to-uff

# Launch an IDE and Start Developing your Application

## Jupyter Notebook

If  `AI-lab`  runs correctly on your machine then  `Jupyter notebook`  should run automatically. If this is not the case, launch it from the terminal with this command

jupyter notebook --allow-root --port=8888 --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser

jupyter notebook

## VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  is an IDE that offers the possibility to develop from inside docker container (thus, inside  `AI-lab`), through the extension  [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack). More details  [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

I have added two configuration folders  `.devcontainer`  and  `.vscode`  to the folder  `AI-LAB_in_vscode`. They are necessary to be able to use VS Code with  `AI-lab`. These two folders are hidden and must live in the directory of your application so that VS Code automatically detects the  `AI-lab`  configuration. Therefore, you need to copy them inside your application folder.

To get these folders, first, clone this repository and move to it

git clone [https://github.com/amineHY/AI-lab.git](https://github.com/amineHY/AI-lab.git) cd /AI-lab

Copy the two folders to your application folder, for instance  `/path_to_folder_application`

sudo cp -R AI-lab/AI-LAB_in_vscode/.* /path_to_folder_application

Finally, move to your application folder

cd /path_to_folder_application

and launch VS Code

code .

# Display the Memory Usage of the GPU

Depending on your development, you might want to watch the memory consumption of your GPU. You can do that thanks to  `gpustat`

watch -n0.5 -c gpustat --c -cupP

Output for my OS:

# Display information about GPU with  `deviceQuery`

in the terminal, run  `deviceQuery`  script (provided in this repository) to get more information about your GPU configuration

./deviceQuery

Output for my OS:
