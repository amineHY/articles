# How to Write and Publish a Research Paper

## The article I wish I read before writing and publishing my research papers

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*nSxXV30zK4RQd61zjAcumQ.jpeg)

You are currently doing your PhD. or interested in doing it in the future. You are maybe about to publish a scientific paper or simply curious about publishing your writing.

In this blog, I write about my experience with writing papers. I share with you tips and what I have learned during my career as a scientific researcher. I have written +7 articles in the top IEEE conferences and journals ([IEEE Transaction on Image Processing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp%3Fpunumber=83)) ([EUSIPCO](http://www.eusipco2018.org/), WOSSPA, GRETSI, GDR-ISIS, …). I also authored a journal paper published in  [Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://aa.org/). You can find the list of my publications in my  [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NXUvxIMAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1)  profile or  [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/M_Amine_Hadj-Youcef)  profile.

I split this blog into two distinct categories, in no particular order:

-   The non-technical part which is related to what needs to be done for the publication
-   The technical part, which is related to the research

🅛🅔🅣’🅢 🅖🅞

# **The Non Technical-Part**

## 📝 The right paper format

You need to select the appropriate format for your paper. There are very different categories of publications such as conference or Periodical, letters, review, conference, or journal article. Depending on the stage of your research or the level of information you are presenting, one may be more appropriate than another for your work to evaluate the message you want to communicate and select your format.

## **🔎 Choosing a Conference**

If you want to submit a conference paper you need to choose which confidence, know that this is an event that you will have to attend. There are a lot of conferences, depending on your research area, each conference with its own location and dates. So make sure to know the top conferences in your fields, it’s important. Don’t hesitate to speak with your supervisors if you are a Ph.D. student, they generally have shortlisted conferences already.

## Details matters

Once you choose the conference, you need to pay attention and read all details regarding the Deadline, Location, Author guidelines, Calls & Submission guidelines, and the Price.

⚠️Yes, you have to pay to publish your work in a peer-reviewed journal/conference. There is a free publications platform (like Medium), or open-source platforms like  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), but without peer review. Of course, don’t forget to pay the publication fees and the registration fees + the hotel in case of a conference paper.

## ⏳ Deadline

Important points regarding the deadline, first of all, you don’t want to miss it!. Second of all, you want to submit before the deadline, obviously. Usually what happens is that authors would like do corrections on the submitted paper, which happens a lot, or maybe update the contents, …. Know that you have the possibility to perform changes on the submitted version before the submission deadline.

💡The earlier you submit your paper the better, give your self comfort and do not wait until the last day to avoid surprises.

## Paper PDF Template kit

Most conferences and journals offer a template Kit to generate the final PDF paper. It is usually proposed in two formats: Microsoft word for Latex. Download the template kit and start editing the content. I make sure you respect the rules of the format (size, font, police, citations, tables, …).

## Editing tool

I really recommend using latex even though it is painful compared to Microsoft word, but trust me, the PDF quality generated using latex is gorgeous.

**💡** I suggest using  [TexStudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)  to edit your paper, it’s one of the best in my opinion.

## Other material to prepare

Accepted conference papers have to be presented on the day of the conference event. Generally, there are two ways of presenting your work:

1- Presenting a poster

2- Or by giving a talk in front of an audience

In both cases, you will have to prepare an additional material summarizing your work, which could be either a poster or slides, it is the conference committee that makes the decision.

## Exception for Journal papers

Regarding the journal paper, the procedure varies slightly. In general, there is no event happening so there is no deadline and there are no events dates. You can submit a journal paper whenever you want. Just make sure that your research is not outdated.

# **The Technical Part**

## 🚀  **Before you start writing**

Asking some question before writing will help you understand your work and better explain it to others, such as

-   Is it an important problem?
-   Is the data collected and analyzed of interest to the wider community?
-   What has been done in the past?
-   Explain why is it important to solve it?

First of all, you need to choose a problem that you want to work on. You must be  **specific**, otherwise, why bother doing a PhD.! Seriously don’t work on a specific problem that has been already addressed by someone else.

## **📎 Literature review**

Getting to know what has been done by other researchers to solve the problem you want to address is key. and what are the advantages what are the limitation of the previous approaches, this is really important and critical in your step because to another for your research to be relevant you need to show and convince the  reader or the university committee that will be charging your work that your contribution is worthy and you are proposing variable research

⚠️ For this step, procrastination  will attempt to be your closest friend. just be aware of it and do not accept it as a friend.

💡 I suggest using  [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/newsfeed)  to manage your references. Simple and easy to use, you can use it on your phone, PC, or browser.

Mendeley

This step will define the foundation of your work so you will start by implementing some methods and get to know what has been done what are the limitations as I said before and from then you will discover what hasn’t been done and sometimes in other research, the researchers highlight what they want to do and what they couldn’t do maybe this will give you an idea to start from and from experience the ones that master this step and go easily for the next steps and those that don’t will struggle and we’ll have to do this work at the end of their thesis.

## **🔧 Developing the Manuscript: Which is first, Results or Writing the Paper ?**

## **From Writing the Paper to Results**

You can start first by writing the paper and filling the blank with content as you move forward in your research. The paper, in this case, will drive your research and will drive your work forward, this is an  anglophone approach.

Filling the blank makes you think about the topic and ask yourself questions, such as what is the topic I want to address? what has been done before? which strategy or methodology should I propose? and so on.

## **From Results to Writing the Paper**

Or you can follow the francophone approach  which consists of focusing on getting the result first then writing paper. This works best for someone who already knows the subject and the problem is addressed. As soon as he gets some results he can start writing the paper. The next task will be to justify an argument and try to fit in among the research in the literature.

There is no good or wrong strategy here, they both work very well, just pick one approach and stick to it.

💡  If you are a PhD. student, don’t hesitate to discuss this with your supervisor. They will guide you and walk you through your PhD.

## **📌 Where to Begin Writing?**

Scientific and technical articles typically follow  [this format](http://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/How-to-Write-for-Technical-Periodicals-and-Conferences-1.pdf):

-   _Abstract_
-   _Introduction_
-   _Previous Research_
-   _Problem Formulation_
-   _Model or Methods and Results_
-   _Conclusion_
-   _References_
-   _Acknowledgments_

Each section of your paper plays a different role in explaining to the reader why your research presents a new and important problem, what has been done before, and how your research substantially advances your field.

💡  I recommend you follow this order: Start by formulating the problem, then writing about the methods you used to solve it, followed by the results. Next, You go back to the introduction, and then your conclusions. The abstract should be written last.

After you have drafted all of the sections, you should revisit your title and author list to be sure it accurately represents your final work. Acknowledgments and references can be completed after the article is written.

## **🗣 Submission &**  **Peer review**

Re-iterate the revision and correction with your co-authors. The more you iterate the better. By the time goes you will converge to a final version of the paper. Also, get your friends or colleagues to review the paper. There could be some mistakes that you can not see. And you are good at submitting your paper.

💡 Remember, always iterate with your co-authors before submitting the paper. You must have their approval to avoid misunderstanding or confusion that might occur.

# **Conclusion and Take Away**

From my personal experience, I can tell that It is normal to be messy while writing, know that’s ok and that is inevitable. Do not get overwhelmed. Be consistent and do not forget to give yourself a break 🙂. You need to create enough order in your writing routine to be able to move forward.

There you have it, I hope you get some value from this blog and you will benefit from it for your next paper. 💯
